We would individually work on features on our own branches and when completed would push to upstream, informing the other team members we had done so. The other team members would then pull from upstream, alerting them to any potential merge conflicts with their features. These conflicts would be more easily resolved while actively working on these conflicting areas. This worked extremely well as conflicts were regularly identified and resolved, and all team members had up-to-date versions of the project.</p>

However, comments differed from articles because a comment also had and articleId foreign key, again because a comment is associated with one article. Additionally comments had a replyTo_Id attribute that was a foreign key of commentId. This was to add in the functionality of being able to reply to comments.  </p>

                        <p>The extra feature we decided to add was a site-wide profanity fitler. It was set up by creating a Regular Expression containing all of the banned words. The profanity filter custom module then used two functions to either assess whether a banned word was found in the input string, using the string.match() function and returning true or false. This was employed in the username check as it was decided that usernames could not contain profanity at all.</p>
                        <img src={ProfanityFilterExample} alt="profanityFilterExample" />
                        <p>The second method was to find the any banned words in the input string and replace them with “****”, returning this ‘censored’ string. The main implementation of this profanity filter was to optionally censor articles. To do this the articles were stored in the database uncensored. If the reader clicked the ‘read censored article’ button, the article was parsed and any banned words replaced.
                        The profanity filter was also saved in a client-side javascript file as it was needed to check inputs such as usernames, and personal descriptions on the signup page. An option to censor an article on writing was also provided in the write article page.</p>
